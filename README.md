## Course Description
This course introduces concepts, algorithms, and techniques of data mining on different types of datasets, which covers basic data mining algorithms, as well as advanced topics on text mining, graph/network mining, and recommender systems. A team-based course project involving hands-on practice of mining useful knowledge from large data sets is required, in addition to regular assignments. The course is a graduate-level computer science course, which is also a good option for senior undergraduate students who are interested in the field as well as students from other disciplines who need to understand, develop, and use data mining systems to analyze large amounts of data.

## Prerequisites
- Required prerequisite courses: CS 145 or CS 146 or equivalent. 
- You are expected to have background knowledge in data structures, algorithms, basic linear algebra, and basic statistics. 
- You are expected to know basic knowledge in data mining and machine learning. 
- You will also need to be familiar with at least one programming language (Python will be used for homework), and have programming experiences. 

## Learning Objectives
- Review and understand fundamentals of basic data mining techniques
- Learn recent data mining techniques on several advanced data types
- Develop skills to apply data mining algorithms to solve real-world applications
- Gain initial experience in conducting research on data mining
